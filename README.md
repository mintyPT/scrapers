# My scrapers

This repository is meant to store some scrappers I wrote. It is not going to be good code but getting the job done kinda type of code. 

I'm making it available because it might be useful for someone.

Will be adding more scrappers over time.

I'm also improving my functions, ideas and workflows to get the job done quicker.

If you need a scraper, feel free to contact me.
