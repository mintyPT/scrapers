# My scrapers

This repository is meant to store some scrappers I wrote over time. They are not pretty but got the job done when needed. I guess they are better here than collecting dust in my HD. I'm making it available because it might be useful for someone.

## Future

Will be adding more scrappers over time. I'm also improving my functions, ideas and workflows to get the job done quicker and better. I could use available libraries and modules but that way I wouldn't learn so much.

## Contact

If you need a scraper, feel free to contact me.
